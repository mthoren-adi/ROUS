    "Simulation of basic FFT operation, SNR calculation\n",
    "Basically, we're making a vector of N time domain\n",
    "samples, then corrupting the signal in several \"real world\" ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, start with a perfect signal, or as perfect as a computer can generate. The computer is using at least 64-bit floating point math, which except in extreme cases with multiple error sources, is more than adequate for our purposes.\n",
    "2.   Quantization noise is added by simply starting with a signal of amplitude\n",
    "2^(number of bits), then truncating the decimal portion with the int function. We'll take a close look at the resulting errors, and observe qualitatively how closely they resemble typical textbook representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop an understanding of analysis in the frequency domain - how to separate signal power and noise power, calculate SNR in ideal cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thermal noise is added to the signal, which is just a random\n",
    "number with a gaussian distribution. This is often referred to as the\n",
    "\"transition noise\" of an ADC, and it can never be smaller than K*T/C where\n",
    "K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C is the size of the\n",
    "ADC's sample capacitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add distortion components to the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random jitter is added to the sample clock. This is an accurate model of\n",
    "wideband clock jitter that is spread across seveal Nyquist bands\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deterministic jitter is added to the sample clock, representing phase noise\n",
    "at a particular frequency. This gives an intuitive understanding of the effect\n",
    "of phase noise as a signal's frequency and amplitude change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then pick apart the signal in the frequency domain, comparing the power in the signal to \"everything else\", which we're assuming to be noise.\n",
    "Shown below is a screenshot from Linear Technology's PScope software, an evaluation tool for ADCs. While not perfect and only targetting proprietary data capture cards, the analysis functions are particularly well thought out. It's worth a half-hour look through the Pscope manual:\n",

    "# Basics of Analog to Digital conversion: Quantization\n",
    "Let's start with the very basics. By that - the most fundamental operation of taking a signal that is continuous in both time and value (or amplitude, signal level, whatever you want to call it), and quantizing it in both time and value. One subtle point is that because we're doing this simulation on a digital computer, every single number is already quantized! The default precision of a NumPy floating point number is 64 bits (11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa) **(need to confirm)** But this quantization level is MUCH MUCH finer than that of the ADCs that we're simulating, which top out at about 32 bits (and even this is a stretch, which we'll dig into later). This is similar to the idea that when making a precise measurement, your measurement instrument should be some factor (often between four and ten times) more precise than the desired measurement precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several signal waveforms that we could use for this illustration, a steady (DC) signal, a ramp, a wavelet of some sort, but we're going to use a sinusoid. Most ADCs that are intended for signal acquisition are characterized with sinusoidal inputs. Sinewaves are relatively easy to generate, and easy to analyze using the Fourier transform. We'll be making extensive use of NumPy, and in this case the cosine function:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cos.html\n",
    "\n",
    "np.cos is simply a function that accepts an array of radian values, and returns an array of the corresponding cosine of those values. There are a few other optional features of the cos function, refer to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",

    "Alrighty, that was a nice warmup! we've compared a single bin worth of signal to the rest of bins as noise, and plotted out the FFT. But why is the FFT output \"mirrored\"? Remember that the output of an FFT has the same number of points as the input data, and bin 1 represents a frequency of fs/N. Visually, this is a sinewave that covers a single cycle over the entire time record. And from Nyquist, the FFT output can only digitize to fs/2, which is the center of the FFT. The right-hand side of the FFT is thus a mirroring of the left side, from fs/2 back to DC. Sort of. It's more accurate to think of it as INCREASING in frequency from fs/t UP to fs! Remember that a signal at fs... will ALIAS to DC!\n",

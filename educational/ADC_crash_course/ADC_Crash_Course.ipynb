    "\n",
    "1.   Thermal noise is added to the signal, which is just a random\n",
    "number with a gaussian distribution. This is often referred to as the\n",
    "\"transition noise\" of an ADC, and it can never be smaller than K*T/C where\n",
    "K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C is the size of the\n",
    "ADC's sample capacitor.\n",
    "2.   Quantization noise is added by simply starting with a signal of amplitude\n",
    "2^(number of bits), then truncating the decimal portion with the int function.\n",
    "3. Random jitter is added to the sample clock. This is an accurate model of\n",
    "wideband clock jitter that is spread across seveal Nyquist bands\n",
    "4. Deterministic jitter is added to the sample clock, representing phase noise\n",
    "at a particular frequency. This gives an intuitive understanding of the effect\n",
    "of phase noise as a signal's frequency and amplitude change.\n",

    "We'll then pick apart the signal in the frequency domain, comparing the power in the signal to \"everything else\", which we're assuming to be noise.\n",

    "Alrighty, that was a nice warmup! we've compared a single bin worth of signal to the rest of bins as noise, and plotted out the FFT. But why is the FFT output \"mirrored\"? Remember that the output of an FFT has the same number of points as the input data, and bin 1 represents a frequency of fs/N. Visually, this is a sinewave that covers a single cycle over the entire time record. And from Nyquist, the FFT output can only digitize to fs/2, which is the center of the FFT. The right-hand side of the FFT is thus a mirroring of the left side, from fs/2 back to DC. Sort of. It's more accurate to think of it as INCREASING in frequency from fs/t UP to fs! Remember that a signal at fs... will ALIAS to DC!\n",

The file format is somewhat proprietary, so the \"save_for_pscope\" library takes care of formatting. Another library, sin_params, is a Python implementation of many of PScope's analysis functions.

    "## Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "Simulation of basic FFT operation, SNR calculation\n",
    "Basically, we're making a vector of N time domain\n",
    "samples, then corrupting the signal in several \"real world\" ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, start with a perfect signal, or as perfect as a computer can generate. The computer is using at least 64-bit floating point math, which except in extreme cases with multiple error sources, is more than adequate for our purposes.\n",
    "2.   Quantization noise is added by simply starting with a signal of amplitude\n",
    "2^(number of bits), then truncating the decimal portion with the int function. We'll take a close look at the resulting errors, and observe qualitatively how closely they resemble typical textbook representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop an understanding of analysis in the frequency domain - how to separate signal power and noise power, calculate SNR in ideal cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Thermal noise is added to the signal, which is just a random\n",
    "number with a gaussian distribution. This is often referred to as the\n",
    "\"transition noise\" of an ADC, and it can never be smaller than K*T/C where\n",
    "K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C is the size of the\n",
    "ADC's sample capacitor.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add distortion components to the signal. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Random jitter is added to the sample clock. This is an accurate model of\n",
    "wideband clock jitter that is spread across seveal Nyquist bands\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deterministic jitter is added to the sample clock, representing phase noise\n",
    "at a particular frequency. This gives an intuitive understanding of the effect\n",
    "of phase noise as a signal's frequency and amplitude change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll then pick apart the signal in the frequency domain, comparing the power in the signal to \"everything else\", which we're assuming to be noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using several analysis tools that serve different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python with NumPy** - this is our workhorse. It's an extremely versatile language with LOTS of packages (NumPy is one of them). Furthermore, we can use it to communicate with hardware when we get to that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The Drawback - with great versatility comes the potential for great confusion! Eventually we'll want some standardized methods for generating and analyzing signals. \"Just use Python\" is not the right answer for that. We'll use Python to explore concepts, then rapidly head toward standard tools for \"real work\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Genalyzer** - this is an Analog Devices developed signal library of DSP functions for RF measurements, but it's fairly general purpose. It is intended to adhere to standard test methods, ideally backed up by IEEE specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visual Analog, Pscope, and ACE** - these are Analog Devices proprietary software packages intended to interface to ADI evaluation boards. It is possible to import data into these packages, although it's a bit cumbersome so we won't dwell on it too much, especially ACE and VA. PScope on the other hand has some very powerful and easy to use analysis functions that can give deep insight into signal chain behavior... IF you can manage to get the data formatted just right :)\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is a screenshot from Linear Technology's PScope software, an evaluation tool for ADCs. While not perfect and only targetting proprietary data capture cards, the analysis functions are particularly well thought out. It's worth a half-hour look through the Pscope manual:\n",

    "# Basics of Analog to Digital conversion: Quantization <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"quantization\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the very basics. By that - the most fundamental operation of taking a signal that is continuous in both time and value (or amplitude, signal level, whatever you want to call it), and quantizing it in both time and value. One subtle point is that because we're doing this simulation on a digital computer, every single number is already quantized! The default precision of a NumPy floating point number is 64 bits (11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa) **(need to confirm)** But this quantization level is MUCH MUCH finer than that of the ADCs that we're simulating, which top out at about 32 bits (and even this is a stretch, which we'll dig into later). This is similar to the idea that when making a precise measurement, your measurement instrument should be some factor (often between four and ten times) more precise than the desired measurement precision. We'll be doing much better than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a (software) Signal Generator\n",
    "There are several signal waveforms that we could use for this illustration, a steady (DC) signal, a ramp, a wavelet of some sort, but we're going to use a sinusoid. Most ADCs that are intended for signal acquisition are characterized with sinusoidal inputs. Sinewaves are relatively easy to generate, and easy to analyze using the Fourier transform. We'll be making extensive use of NumPy, and in this case the cosine function:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.cos.html\n",
    "\n",
    "np.sin is simply a function that accepts an array of radian values, and returns an array of the corresponding sine of those values. There are a few other optional features of the sin function, refer to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enough dragging on here, let's build up the first incarnation of our signal generator, heavily commented :) \n"

Remember that the output of an FFT has the same number of points as the input data, and bin 1 represents a frequency of fs/N. Visually, this is a sinewave that covers a single cycle over the entire time record. And from Nyquist, the FFT output can only digitize to fs/2, which is the center of the FFT. The right-hand side of the FFT is thus a mirroring of the left side, from fs/2 back to DC. Sort of. It's more accurate to think of it as INCREASING in frequency from fs/t UP to fs! Remember that a signal at fs... will ALIAS to DC!\n",

    "So far, the only imperfections we've introduced are quantization noise (which is actually a property of the signa chain) and non-coherent effects (which are mathematical artifacts.) Now we're going to add in thermal noise, which will ALWAYS exist in any signal. In fact, let's start with a useful simplification and assume that our signal chain is absolutely perfect, and the ADC's sampling circuit is the ONLY source of noise. Many ADC architectures have a sample and hold circuit that captures a sample on a small capacitor with a network of switches as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**To Do: Add LTspice pic**\n",
    "\n",
    "The very act of capturing a sample on a capacitor, even a perfect one, introduces noise. If you repeatedly capture a noiseless signal on a capacitor of size C, then the resulting samples will NOT be perfect; they will have a distribution of voltages with a standard deviation of:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQRT(K*T/C)\n",

    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "K = Boltzmann's constant (1.380649 Ã— 10-23 J/K)\n",
    "T = absolute temperature in Kelvin\n",
    "C = capacitance in farads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to an ADC's \"number of bits\", the sample capacitor (along with the full-scale input range) represents an UPPER LIMIT on an ADC's Signal to Noise ratio. Let's look at a real example, the LTC2202. This is a \"16-bit\" ADC, with a 2.5Vp-p input range, and two 9.1pF sample capacitors. (See datasheet Figure 2.) This gives a thermal noise of:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQRT(1.380649 Ã— 10^-23 * 300 * 9.1 x 10^-12) * SQRT(2) = 30.31 uVRMS thermal noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the extra SQRT(2) is due to the fact that the two inputs are independently sampled on two 9.1pF capacitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input range is 2.5Vp-p, or 0.8839 VRMS. The theoretical maximum SNR is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "20 * log(0.8839 / 30.31 * 10^-6) = 89 dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is 9 dB lower than the theoretical 98.08 dB SNR for a 16-bit converter. Does this mean that we can just not bother reading out one of the bits? Well, if you were ONLY measuring SNR, then yes. But look at this part's integral nonlinearity and distorition - 1.2 lsb and 100 dB under some conditions, respectively. So while the thermal noise dominates the quantization noise, those bits are still required in order to get full linearity performance. A somewhat simplistic way of looking at it is that linearity and distortion require many codes across the ADC's input range to express, so noise will tend to average out. (A subject for another section.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's run the LTC2202 thermal noise and quantization noise through Genalyzer and see what we get out...\n",

The test frequency was 10 MHz, so let's pick 10ps (10e-12 seconds) of jitter, which should give us an SNR of about 65 dB, according to the chart. And plugging into the formula gives 64.03 dB.\n",
